When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
>> This would be the cases when I want to share my work and collaborate with others. Then others can also pull my work, 
   make changes and push those to the remote.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
>> I would not want git to pull unneccessary changes, or pull changes when I am developing a new feature based on the current files. That could cause lots of issues and thus I will spend most of my time resolving conflicts and making my changes compatible with the lates files just pulled. Also, it would be much easir if I manually decide when to pull new changes, maybe after deciding if they need to be pulled.
